FireTitle
=========

An extension for **enhanced presentation of titles** in tabs and title bars of Firefox. 

The original _FireTitle_:

- uses a legacy technology (XUL)
- is stable, but no longer developed
- may be effectively passed through the [Extension Converter for SeaMonkey](http://addonconverter.fotokraina.com/)
- will not work with Firefox 57.

The new _Crappy Firetitle_: 

- is for Firefox 56 and later
- is constrained by [WebExtensions APIs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions).
