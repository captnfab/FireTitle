FireTitle
=========

Thanks for installing/upgrading FireTitle.

This is the last upgrade of FireTitle XUL version. It won't be supported
anymore as it won't work on Firefox 57+ versions.

There is a new Webextension version, called (for now) "Crappy Firetitle". This
version is still experimental and has less features that the original FireTitle
add-on since it is constrained by [WebExtensions
APIs](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions).

We hope Firefox developers will enable us to port the missing features before
Firefox 57 release so that _Crappy Firetitle_ won't be that crappy.
